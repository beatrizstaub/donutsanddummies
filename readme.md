This is my first sketch for the Interactive Graphics Class. 
I do not have personal reasons behind why I chose to depict The Simpsons; I searched Google for a donut because it is one of my favorite American desserts and I find the colors appealing. I found a picture of Bart when searching for a pink donut and found that the image could use fun interactions. So then I started playing around with my code and this is what I got.
I hope you guys all enjoy it :)
