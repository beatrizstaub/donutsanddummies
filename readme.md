This is my first sketch for the Interactive Graphics Class. 
I do not have personal reasons behind why I chose to depict The Simpsons, or donuts, or dummies. However, I can tell you how my art piece progressed into this. I searched Google for a donut because it is one of my favorite American desserts and I find the colors appealing. I stumbled across a picture of Bart when searching for a pink donut and found that the image could use fun interactions. So then I started playing around with my code and wanted to add more fun parts to it. That's when I had the idea of displaying Maggie and her dummy.
